# React_Vite_App
Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and
leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:A dev server 
that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production. 
Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript 
API with full typing support.

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
